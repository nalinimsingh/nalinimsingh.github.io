## About
I'm a PhD student at the [Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology](https://hst.mit.edu/academics/memp), working in the [Medical Vision Group](groups.csail.mit.edu/vision/medical-vision/) with [Polina Golland](http://people.csail.mit.edu/polina/). I'm interested in using signal processing and machine learning to better understand and act upon medical data. 

Previously, I did my undergrad in the [Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](http://www.eecs.mit.edu/) department at MIT. I've also worked at [Google](http://www.google.com), [IBM Research](http://www.research.ibm.com), and [Draper](http://www.draper.com/).
