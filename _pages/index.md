## About
I'm a PhD student at the [Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology](https://hst.mit.edu/academics/memp). I work in the [Medical Vision Group](https://www.csail.mit.edu/research/medical-vision-group) with [Polina Golland](http://people.csail.mit.edu/polina/).

My primary research interests are in machine learning, computer vision, and signal processing applied to medical data, especially medical image reconstruction and analysis.

Previously, I did my undergrad in [Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](http://www.eecs.mit.edu/) at MIT and did research internships at [Google Brain/Health](http://health.google), [IBM Research](http://www.research.ibm.com), and [Draper](http://www.draper.com/).

I also started [Blueprint](https://blueprint.hackmit.org) and served as the president of [MIT HKN](https://hkn.mit.edu).
