## About
I'm a PhD student at the [Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology](https://hst.mit.edu/academics/memp). I work in the [Medical Vision Group](https://www.csail.mit.edu/research/medical-vision-group) with [Polina Golland](http://people.csail.mit.edu/polina/). Previously, I did my undergrad in [Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](http://www.eecs.mit.edu/) at MIT.

My primary research interests are in machine learning, computer vision, and signal processing applied to medical data, especially medical image reconstruction and analysis. 

My work is supported by the [NIH Neuroimaging Training Program](https://hst.mit.edu/academic-programs/memp/neuroimaging-training-program), an [NSF Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/), and a [Google PhD Fellowship](https://research.google/outreach/phd-fellowship/).

I also run the [MEMP Application Assistance Program](https://maap.mit.edu), to assist students applying to the HST PhD program. If you have questions about that process, that site is the best place to sign up for help.
