## About
I'm a PhD student at the [Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology](https://hst.mit.edu/academics/memp), working in the [Medical Vision Group](groups.csail.mit.edu/vision/medical-vision/) with [Polina Golland](http://people.csail.mit.edu/polina/). I'm interested in using signal processing and machine learning to better understand and act upon medical data. 

Previously, I did my undergrad in the [Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](http://www.eecs.mit.edu/) department at MIT. I've worked at [Google](http://www.google.com), [IBM Research](http://www.research.ibm.com), and [Draper](http://www.draper.com/).

I also co-founded [Blueprint](https://blueprint.hackmit.org) and served as the president of [MIT HKN](https://hkn.mit.edu).

Predicting Alarm Relevance in Neonatal Intensive Care Units
</summary>
<div class='fulltext' markdown="1">
Bedside monitors alert clinicians of adverse events in Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) patients. However, high false alarm rates in these devices desensitize NICU staff to useful warnings. We developed classifiers that use physiologic waveform data to predict alarm relevance and could be used to silence unnecessary alarms.

Predicting Adverse Drug Reactions with Molecular Docking Scores
</summary>
<div class='fulltext' markdown="1">
Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) produce an estimated 700,000 ER visits each year in the United States. We developed models that use only structural drug information to predict ADRs, enabling ADR identification _before_ experimental testing in patients.

Analyzing Acute Kidney Injury in Septic Intensive Care Patients
</summary>
<div class='fulltext' markdown="1">
Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) is associated with increased mortality in septic patients. We performed a retrospective cohort study to analyze mean arterial blood pressure as a predictor of AKI.

Designing Biomimetic Prosthesis Controllers for Walking
</summary>
<div class='fulltext' markdown="1">
We designed and modeled a state space controller for prosthesis-aided walking based on motion capture data from animal experiment subjects. The resulting controller yielded gait parameters within 7% of biological values.

Localizing Parafoils in GPS-Denied Environments
</summary>
<div class='fulltext' markdown="1">
The Army is developing airdrop systems capable of delivering supplies to troops in environments where GPS data is unavailable due to jamming, spoofing, or poor satellite visibility. We developed computer vision algorithms for parafoil localization and navigation that require only monocular camera imagery and inertial sensor data.
